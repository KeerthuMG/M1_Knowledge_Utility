# INTRODUCTION <BR/>
Calculator is a device which performs arithmetic and other mathematical operations. Initially it starts with basic functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Followed by roots, logarithms, trigonometric functions and hyperbolic functions, factorial and power.

# FEATURES <BR/>
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Square
6. Modulus
7. Factorial

In this project, some of the basic operations and advanced operations are created.

# 4W's and 1H <BR/>
# WHO <BR/>
1. Students can use for their academic work.
2. Datascience workers working on machine learning and deep learning applications.
3. Software engineers
4. Researchers and mathematicians

# WHEN <BR/>
1. When students facing difficulty in solving problems.
2. Researchers can use it for getting a quick output.
3. Comes to a great use when calculating a huge number.

# WHERE <BR/>
1. Calculator is something which can be used anywhere like educational institutions, research area, bank, employees and soon on.

# WHY <BR/>
1. It is a machine which allows humans to get accurate and quick results easier.
2. It solves more complicated problems quickly.

# HOW <BR/>
